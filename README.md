       PHP output: http://adamwk97.epizy.com/module%207.php

My PHP code for this week looks like: 

```
<?php
function Student($name, $year, $major) {
  echo "$name is a $year studying $major. \n <br>";
}

Student("Adam", "Senior", "Data Science");
Student("Zack", "Sophomore", "Biology");
Student("Molly", "Freshman", "Nursing");

?>

<?php
$string = "This is my PHP string for Module: ";
echo "$string 7 <br/>";
?>
```

This was my first time working with PHP and so far it seems like a mix between HTML and RMD format. I found it intuitive to display 
what I wanted to with help from the powerpoint slides. I think using functions like these inside of strings would be quite useful for
creating and working on a website.
